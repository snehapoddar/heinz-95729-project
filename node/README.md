Build Tools
==================

We use grunt for many things: running the app, running tests, environment setup.

## Getting Started

Before you can run the app, you need to install the dependencies. To do this, `cd` into the build directory and run `npm install` to install the packages for our grunt tasks. Once that is complete, you can run `grunt install`, which will automagically install dependencies from **npm** and **bower** for each project.

To find out what else you can `grunt`, run `grunt help`.
